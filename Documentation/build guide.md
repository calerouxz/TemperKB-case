## Preparing the case base

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you use the self-tap variant of the case, you can skip this step.
> Keep in mind, this version of the case is **untested** by myself.

You will first need to prepare the case base, inserting the heat-set inserts onto the base. You can use a soldering iron for this operation.

- Insert 5 M2x3mm heat-set inserts into the mounting pockets. Repeat for the other side.
- Insert 1 M2x4mm heat-set insert into the pole to hold the top cover. Repeat for the other side.

## Preparing the PCB assembly
1. Place the PCB onto the switch plate, making sure it is fully seated.

2. Screw on the 5 M2x3mm screws frome the bottom of the PCB to the switch plate. These should self-tap onto the switch plate.

3. Turn the assemby over and place your switches on the assembly.
4. Place the supplemental PCB holder on the PCB, right next to the MCU.

Repeat these 4 steps on the other side.

This is how the completed assembly should look like:

## Assemble the keyboard
1. Place 5 o-rings on their respective pockets on the **case base**.
2. Place the PCB assembly on the case base, making sure the mounting points line up over the o-rings and their pockets.
3. Place the power switch cover, lining up the small tab on the on/off switch with the power switch cover's slot.
4. Place the top cover on the case base.
5. Screw 5 M2x10mm screws on protrusions, These should line up with the switch plate and o-ring.
6. Screw 1 M2x6mm screw on the additional tab of the top cover to secure it to the bottom base.
7. Place the feet on the bottom of the assembly.

Repeat these 7 steps on the other side.
