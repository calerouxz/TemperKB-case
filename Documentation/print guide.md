# Print guide
For context, I printed all parts using a Bambulab A1, using a 0.16mm layer height on all parts. 0.20mm layer heights will work as well.

I designed most parts with a 0.20mm tolerance value. Using these values should give a tight fit.

The holes on the switch plate and top cover have a 0.30mm tolerance value to make it easier to introduce the screws.

## Switch plate
The switch plate is not particularly difficul to print, but be mindful of your filament and the large flat area it requires, as with some filaments it could lead to warping. 

I *recommend* printing this part in PET-G as it will minimally bend and deform on the pockets while typing. PET-G may prove to be a more durable material for this particular part, but I also tested these in PLA and they worked fine.

I printed the part using white polymaker PET-G and did not have any issues.

Mirror the left side to get the right side.

## Supplemental PCB holder
The supplemental PCB holder is probably the hardest part to print due to the horizontal overhang needed to fit it onto the PCB, which needs supports.

I printed this part face-side down and then used supports on the cavity. This was done to preserve accuracy on the mount area.

You can *try* to print this part in other orientations if you choose to avoid supports (**not tested by myself**).

I printed the part using white polymaker PET-G.

## Power switch covers
This part does **not** require to be mirrored.

Print this part with the point facing up. You will have a small overhang between the bases, in various prints this has not been an issue.

I printed the part using white polymaker PET-G.

## Case base
The case base has quite intricate details on the mounting pockets.

I suggest turning on supports for the small pockets for the feet on the bottom, this will allow them to be cleaner.

Some filaments will require heavy brims to ensure you get no warping due to the large flat surface. 

I printed using Bambulab matte charcoal PLA. This particular filament did prove problematic due to warping on some of my test prints. I had to clean the plate and use heavy brims to get the quality I wanted. I also did a test print in Hatchbox orange PLA with no issues using no brims.

I have made available a self-tap version of the base model, having a 1.9mm screw clearance. Keep in mind I have personally not tested this version of the case.

## Case top cover
The top cover should have similar settings to the case base. This part may or may not use brims debending on your particular filament. My particular filament did require a brim in order to keep warping to a minimum.
