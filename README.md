# Temper Gasket Case
This is a case for Raeedcho's **Temper** keyboard.

## Objectives for the case
When designing this case for the **Temper**, I had the following objectives:

1. Include a 'gasket' mounting method.
2. Add some refinement to the case, creating a more end-product feeling design.
3. Include an easier to use on/off switch that fits onto the small one on the board.

## Complexity
Keep in mind that this is a relatively complex assembly and *does* require additional hardware (screws, heat-set inserts and o-rings). There is also a fair amount of 3D printed parts that need to fit together. 

## Documentation
The following documentation is meant to help you build the case:

1. BOM (Bill of Materials)
2. 3D print guide
3. Build guide
4. Change log
